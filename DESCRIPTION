Description:  Implements the clustering aspect of VariScan, a nonparametric Bayesian
              technique for clustering, variable selection, and prediction in
              high-throughput regression settings. Poisson-Dirichlet processes are
              utilized to detect lower-dimensional latent clusters of covariates.
              An adaptive nonlinear prediction model is constructed for the response,
              achieving a balance between model parsimony and flexibility. The
              methodology is described in Guha and Baladandayuthapani (EJS, 2016).
